# UART-Protocol
Development of a complete UART communication flow, from RTL implementation to advanced verification. The work features structured design in Verilog, layered SystemVerilog test environments, and UVM-based stimulus generation. Emphasis is placed on interface reliability, protocol timing accuracy, and reusable verification infrastructure aimed at system-level learning and FPGA experimentation.
